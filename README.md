### Hello, I'm Tamara! 👩‍💻

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Media Informatics and am currently studying Cyber Security in my Master's program.  
My interests lie at the intersection of technology, creativity, and visual design.

I love working on cute games, thoughtful UI/UX concepts, and anything that involves a bit of fun and charm.  
Also, I'm a big cat lover — both in real life and in pixel form! 🐱🎮

Here you'll find some of my projects and experiments as I continue learning and growing in the tech world.
